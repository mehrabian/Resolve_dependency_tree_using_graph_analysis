1. The program is written in Python. To run the program you need to have  python 3 or higher on your system.
-- to show help part of the code execute python resolveDependencyTree.py --help

2. To execute the program run:
    python resolveDependencyTree.py --name [arbitrary number of distribution names] --path [relative path to the data directory]
-- example:
    python resolveDependencyTree.py --name DateTime Dist-CheckConflicts --path data/
Note that for this case the data folder is in the same place as the python code
Code will check for the required packages and if they are not avaible it will print an error message with the guidelines to install it

3. Few tests are written for the code which are inside the test_code.py program. To run the test code, execute:
    pytest -vv
Note that for testing the data folder should be in the same folder as the main code.
if pytest is not avaible on your system install it by running:
conda install pytest or pip install pytest
